# HIV-Gender-Inequality
This project focuses on visualizing the impact of HIV/AIDS in terms of the number of deaths that occurred between 1990 and 2019 in different locations. It utilizes an area chart to represent the trends in HIV-related deaths over time.

Additionally, the project includes a filled map that depicts the average number of deaths per 1 lakh population in various areas. This visualization allows for a comparison of the impact of HIV/AIDS across different regions.

Furthermore, the project presents data on the number of males and females living with HIV/AIDS. It also showcases the estimated number of new HIV infections and the average incidence rate of new HIV infections per 1000 people. These aspects are represented using column charts, offering insights into the prevalence and transmission of HIV/AIDS.

To enhance the analysis and provide a clearer understanding of the data, the project incorporates a gender filter. This filter enables users to examine the impact of HIV/AIDS according to gender, allowing for a more detailed exploration of the disparities and patterns that may exist.

By employing various visualizations and interactive features, this project provides a comprehensive overview of the HIV/AIDS situation, including deaths, prevalence, and new infections, while also allowing for specific gender-based analyses.
